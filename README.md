# GoogleEarthEngine-TimeSeriesAnalysis
This notebook uses the Google Earth Engine API to perform a time series analysis of Lake Poopó (Bolivia). The intention of this notebook is to calculate the water surface and volume of Lake Poopó for individual months and years using satellite data to compare them with corresponding climatic datasets, like precipitation and evapotranspiration rates. In addition, the water surfaces of Lake Titicaca of several years were added to establish a possible correlation between the water levels of these two lakes, which are connected by the Desaguadero River.
